Vim is magic.

Around 9 months ago, I stumbled upon a video by ThePrimeagen that changed everything:

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"

Being an Arch Linux (btw) user, I was familiar with Vim, but mostly for simple config changes. I used VSCode for "serious work" (bad React apps). After that video, I promptly switched to NeoVim and embraced Vim motions.

Fastforward to now, I still use NeoVim. It's one of my best decisions I've made and has significantly improved my skills as a developer.

## What are Vim Motions?

Let's clarify: this post focuses on Vim motion's benefits, not just Vim, the text editor.

Vim motions are powerful text-editing shortcuts. While synonymous with Vim, they're available through extensions in IDEs like VSCode, and even [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

## Why Use Vim Motions?

As seen in the video, Vim motions are:
- Fast
- Efficient
- Really really cool

Vim motions enable **blazingly fast** text traversal and evoke Hollywood-style hacker vibes by eliminating mouse use.

Programming involves a lot of coding, reading, and editing. You're going to be spending a lot of time doing these things as
a developer, so it makes sense to invest the time learning and getting really good with your tools. 

## Getting Started

Vim has a steep learning curve; early progress might be slow. Embrace it, master the basics, and soon you'll be flying.

Ready to begin?

Start with VimTutor:

- On Linux and MacOS, Vim comes preinstalled.
- On Windows, you need to [install Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php#pc)

Then run "vimtutor" in your terminal or command line and follow the instructions from there.

Additional learning resources:
- [ThePrimeagen's Vim as your editor series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R&ab_channel=ThePrimeagen)
- [VimGenius](http://www.vimgenius.com/)
- [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
- [FreeCodeCamp's Vim Cheatsheet](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/why-using-neovim-data-engineer-and-writer-2023/vim-language-cheetsheet.png)

Even if Vim isn't your go-to text editor, Vim motions can enhance modern IDEs via extensions. Start with your current editor and its Vim plugin.
Once you're ready, give NeoVim a try and see if you like customising your own IDE.

Thanks for reading. May Vim transform your coding experience as it did mine.
