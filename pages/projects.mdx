Leveraged the Google Workspace Gmail API to execute a range of CRUD operations,
complementing this approach with a smart caching system designed to minimize the required number of asynchronous calls.
(Circumventing reaching Google's rate limit under strenuous use).
For the terminal-based frontend I used [gocui](https://github.com/awesome-gocui/gocui).

For the frontend, we utilized Wails with JS/React, complemented by a robust Go backend. The primary hardware platform employed was the M5Stick (ESP32), and the coding was done in Arduino/C++.

The firmware served a dual purpose: it generated a BIP39 seed phrase and facilitated the creation of multiple secure cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets were safeguarded with PIN security and offered the option to recover them using a seed phrase.

Additionally, the desktop application provided several features, including the ability to check current Ethereum prices, reset wallets, and perform ETH transactions, both sending and receiving."
