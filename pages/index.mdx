# Alex Chau

Hi I'm Alex, a final year Computer Systems Engineering student at Queen Mary University of London.

I'm a Linux enthusiast (yes I use Arch btw), I love coding in NeoVim and learning new things about Software Engineering.

Here are some languages I use:

- Go
- Rust (Currently learning)
- Haskell (Currently learning)
- JavaScript & TypeScript (React & NodeJS)
- C
- Python
- Java
- SQL (Mainly Postgres or MySQL using ORMs in Go)
- HTML
- CSS

As part of my studies I've also written VHDL and Assembly.

I also have experience using:

- Docker
- Git 
- Github Actions


The reason for learning so many languages is to simply understand programming at all levels, I'm learning Rust
due to it's high level of control it provides to the developer and Haskell since Rust draws from it's type system.
I also am interested in learning a paradigm (Functional) other than OOP which is taught in my studies.
