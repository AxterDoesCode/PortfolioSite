## Hey, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a Computer Systems Engineering student in my final year at Queen Mary University of London. This might not be the flashiest portfolio site, but it's built with Markdown and [Nextra](https://nextra.site/),
so I can quickly add content and spend more time on my other cool projects (backend focused). I don't suck at frontend though, I'd just rather not.
You can find some of my React work on [my GitHub](https://github.com/AxterDoesCode) for a fancier look.

## About Me

I'm all about that Linux life (yeah, I use Arch btw ðŸ˜„), and I'm a big fan of coding in NeoVim.
Learning new stuff in Software Engineering is my jam.

### Languages I Use

I dabble in a bunch of programming languages, like:

- Go (This language is probably my favourite)
- Rust (Currently fighting the borrow checker)
- Haskell (why -> are -> functions -> like -> this)
- JavaScript & TypeScript (Love me some React and Node.js, sometimes)
- C (Also great)
- Python (Great but not very performant)
- Java (OOP is not bad but I prefer composition over inheritance)
- SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite)
- HTML (Is this even a programming language?)
- CSS (I have much better things to do with my life than styling a box)

In my studies, I've used VHDL and Assembly. 

### My Tech Toolkit

I've got some experience with these handy tools and tech:

- Docker
- Git
- GitHub Actions

## Learning the Code Game

I'm all about learning different programming languages to understand the game at every level. 
Rust has my attention so I can tell people I code in Rust, and I'm diving into Haskell
because functional programming is interesting and I'm doing my final year project in Haskell.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio. If you're up for some cool collaborations or just want to chat tech, feel free to reach out!
